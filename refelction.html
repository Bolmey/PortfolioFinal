Building the website for this class has been a rewarding journey that allowed me
to apply and consolidate my 4+ years of experience in web development.
Navigating through the basics of web development in a beginner's class provided
a unique perspective, as I had to revisit fundamental concepts, and doing this
refreshed my memory. This experience reinforced my technical skills and honed my
ability to use css more efficiently. Crafting a website demanded a thoughtful
approach, compelling me to simplify intricate concepts without compromising on
functionality or design. <br />
The project has significant implications for my career growth, acting as a
testament to my adaptability. I have demonstrated my capacity to work with
diverse skill levels in web development. This experience has heightened my
ability to collaborate, a crucial skill in the dynamic world of technology.
Furthermore, showcasing this project in my portfolio positions me as not just a
seasoned web developer but also as someone capable of breaking down complex
topics, which can open doors to new opportunities. All-in-all I enjoyed updating
my portfolio website and I believe this course was very helpful. I recommend
this course to any beginner web developers and even seasoned veterans.<br />
Thank you Professor for the guidance and newfound knowledge.
